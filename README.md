# go-microservices

#### Note
This is a repository demo microservice architecture with golang. I will practice with some 
patterns like: cqrs, event sourcing, event driven, saga ... Using docker and k8s to deploy, apply unit-test, 
integration-test, load-test, stress-test. Using some monitoring such as jaeger, grafana. Event 
architecture: Kafka or Nats-Jetstream, Database: postgres.
